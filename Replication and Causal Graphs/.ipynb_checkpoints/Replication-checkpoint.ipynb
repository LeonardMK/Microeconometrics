    "Niehaus and Sukthankar build upon a paper from Gary S. Becker and George J. Stigler (1974) in which they argue that a principial can reduce corruption by paying an efficiency wage. From here Niehaus and Sukthankar pick off and argue that a wage increase of the official's subordinates could lead to a change in the official's rent extraction expectatioins as well. Officials face the tradeoff of extracting higher rents today against surviving, to extract rents in the future. If the increased utility of future rents offsets the immediate gain, because officials expecting higher rents in the future, this could lead to a weaker increase in corruption. Niehaus and Sukhtankar call this the \"golden goose\" effect since officials want to preserve the goose that lays the golden eggs which is a reference to the fable. To underpin their argument Niehaus and Sukthankar propose an economic model describing the official's optimization problem, which I will outline in the theoretical chapter."

    "To test for \"golden goose\" effects Niehaus and Sukhtankar use panel data from the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) which is India's largest rural welfare program. Under this scheme every rural household has the right to 100 days of paid labor and can otherwise claim unemployment benefits. NREGS projects typically include construction of roads and irrigation systems. At the beginning of each year a shelf of projects is approved either at the panchayat level (village level) or at the block level (intermediate administrative unit) although higher up officials often propose or approve shelfs of projects. Work is either compensated on a daily-wage or on a piece rate basis. In practice each project uses the same type of payment and there is a clear range of daily-wage and piece-rate projects. For example all irrigation projects involving digging trenches use piece-rate payments. This difference in payment schemes is important to keep in mind for the later part of Niehaus and Sukhtankar's analysis.  \n",
    "Officials can gain illicit rents in this context through the following forms project selection, overreporting of labor, underpaying workers or stealing materials. Consequently officials are monitored by workers and by higher up officials. Officials that get caught either face suspension or relocation to dead-end jobs.  \n",
    "For their analysis Niehaus and Sukthankar use data from the state of Orissa which announced a wage increase for daily wage projects on the 28.04.2007 which came into effect on the 01.05.2007. The policy change was proposed by the state government of Orissa and saw a wage increased from 50Rs. to 70Rs. for one day of labor. This wage hike was limited to daily-wage projects only. Niehaus and Sukhtankar argue for the exogeneity of the policy since the officials are removed from the policymakers.  \n",
    "Niehaus and Sukthankar use individual level [official data](http://nrega.nic.in) which includes personal information like age and residency. Also they get information about the official amount paid and the type of project. Besides data from Orissa they also gathered observations from Andra Pradesh to use as a control in later analysis.  \n",
    "To get an actual measure of corruption Niehaus and Sukthankar sampled 1938 households from the official data to ask them about about the type of project (daily-wage or piece-rate), the amount of work done and the payment they received. Additionally village officials were questioned about the local labor market conditions, seasons and official visits."

Column 2 adds district fixed effects $\\delta_{d(p)}$ and column 3 adds a linear trend interacted with the shock term. Columns 4-6 are estimates of equation $(4)$. As expected $\\beta_2$ is positive, however, the effect is only significant to the level of 10% in column 4. This means that for panchayats that also make use of piece-rate projects the shock didn't increase overreporting significantly. The prediction for $\\beta_3$ holds as well. In all specifications the effect of the shock is negative for panchayats that employ only daily-wage projects. Again the effects are only weakly significant (p < 0.1)."

Here the effect of the shock itself is significant in all specifications to the level of 5%. Since panchayats with $Fwd.\\ DW\\ Frac. = 0$ are the reference class this implies an increase of corruption for said panchayats. The effect for panchayats with $Fwd.\\ DW\\ Some = 1$ is insignificant implying similar effects as for panchayats with $Fwd.\\ DW\\ Frac. = 0$. For panchayats that have only planned daily-wage projects in the next two months $(Fwd.\\ DW\\ All = 1)$ the effect is, nonetheless, negative and highly significant, after controlling for backward shelf composition (column 4-6). From this Niehaus and Sukthankar derive the conclusion that there are substitution mechanics at play for the latter panchayats. Although the effect for $Shock x (Bwd.\\ DW\\ Some)$ is negative and signficant Niehaus and Sukthankar note that when replacing the categories of $Fdw.\\ DW\\ Frac.$ with the actual variable the effect turns out to be insignificant.

    "To test propostion 2 Niehaus and Sukthankar focus next on the effect of the shock on theft from piece-rate projects.

    "From Figure 5 we can see that there was a strong decrease in theft from piece-rate projets which coincided with the shock. Yet, the effect seems to be temporary with a strong increase in rent extraction in June  (Day 150 to 170). Niehaus and Sukthankar speculate that this could be due to the monsoon season starting in late June in Orissa, during which NREGS activities are usually ceased. Officials would then try to extract more before the monsoon season starts.  \n",
    "Table 4A and Table 4B are estimated using a similar regression setup as for daily-wage projects. Remember from proposition 2 that we expect the effect of the wage hike to be a decrease in piece-rate projects. We see that throughout Table 4A the effect of the shock is negative (as expected) and that it is significant to the level 5% (except column 2-3). Similar as in Table 3A column 4-6 allows for differing effects for panchayats that ran only piece-rate projects and those that didn't. The interaction term is negative though insignificant suggesting that these panchayats aren't incentivized more than other panchayats, to reduce piece-rate project reports."

Their robustness checks include changing the time window of the forward and backward project-shelf composition variables ($Fwd.\\ DW\\ Frac.,\\ Bwd.\\ DW\\ Frac.$) to one a three month periods. Further they estimate regression models with the difference between official and actual quantities as the dependent variable. It turns out that all these approaches yield qualtitatively similar results. The results of these regressions can be found [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-LeonardMK/tree/master/Replication%20and%20Causal%20Graphs/tables) and were reproduced using this [file](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/student-project-LeonardMK/blob/master/Replication_Program.ipynb)"

    "Another possible reaction to the wage change is a change in monitioring intensity. If those panchayats that reported high usage of daily-wage projects were controlled more frequently this could explain the negative and significant effect of $Shock\\ x\\ (Fwd.\\ DW\\ All)$. However, the effect of $Bwd.\\ DW\\ Frac.$ should then play a greater role.  \n",
    "To test for these changes Niehaus and Sukthankar use data from their village level survey on the most recent visists of block development officiers (BDO) and the district collector. For the panchayats that were actually visited they test whether the likelihood of a visit went up after May 2007. Niehaus and Sukthankar assume that the probability of a panchayat receiving a visit is indepent across months. Let $t$ be the month in which a panchayat was lastly visited, $p(\\tau|\\theta, d)$ is the probability that district $d$ receives a visit at time $\\tau$. They further assume that $p$ is in logit form.\n",

The parameter of interest here is $\\gamma$ which was tested for being different from zero. If the wage change had an effect on monitoring we would see significant positive $\\gamma$ values. Problematic about these results is that I was unable to replicate them even from the original *R* code. However, the results are qualitatively nearly the same. All coefficients are either non-significant or negative. Leading to the same interpretation that the probability of a visit didn't increase after the wage hike."
